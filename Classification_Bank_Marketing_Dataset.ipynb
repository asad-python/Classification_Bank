        "In machine  learning  and statistics,  classification  is the problem  of identifying  to which  of a set of categories (sub-populations)  a new observation  belongs,  based  on a training  set of data containing observations  (or instances)  whose  category membership  is known. Examples of classification problems are assigning  a given email to the \"spam\" or \"non-spam\" class, and assigning  a diagnosis  to a given patient  based  on observed  characteristics  of the patient  (sex,  blood pressure, presence  or absence of certain symptoms, etc.)\n",

        "In this notebook we will use the [Bank Marketing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset) from Kaggle to build a model to predict whether someone is going to make a deposit or not depending on some attributes. We wiill try to build 4 models using different algorithm Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors. After building each model we will evalueate them and compare which model are the best for our case. We will then try to optimze our model by tuning the hyper paramters of the model by using GridSearch. Lastly, we will save the prediction result from our dataset and then save our model for reussability.\n",

        "For a simple model we can see that our model did decently on classifying the data. But there are still some weakness on our model, especially shown on the recall metric where we only get about 60%. This means that our model are only able to detect 60% of potential customer and miss the other 40%. The result is not that much different after optimising the model using `GridSearchCV` which can means that we hit our limit with this model. To improve our performance we can try to look into another algorithm such as `GradientBoostingClassifier`.\n",
